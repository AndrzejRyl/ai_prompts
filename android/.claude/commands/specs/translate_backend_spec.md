Please look at @CLAUDE.md to understand what type of project we're working on and look on all docs in @ai-specs.
Those are specs for previous features we were working on in this project and guidelines on how to build such specs.
Today we're going to build a new spec. We are ONLY building the spec. NO CODING PLEASE. NO RUNNING COMMANDS. Just simple
spec creation. Below you will find description of the feature we will be building spec for.
Please remember to include sections for progress tracking and learnings.
Today we're building a spec based on backend spec from $ARGUMENTS. Please read it carefully and build our next spec based on what was changed on Backend. 
Please investigate Android codebase thoroughly to keep patterns and mechanisms from Android codebase. Backend spec is only here to explain what has changed in API.
