Please create a mobile API spec based on #$ARGUMENTS. The mobile spec should be technology-agnostic and written for mobile developers who need to understand the API contract. Save it to @ai-specs/mobile_specs folder.
Include: endpoints overview, request/response examples, error responses, and usage examples.
NO backend implementation details. Just the API contract.
