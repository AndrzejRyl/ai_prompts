Please create a spec file in folder @ai-specs/ios_specs for iOS developers with description of 
what we just build in $ARGUMENTS I want explanation how it was implemented in Android, 
what kind of backend endpoints were used/added, what models have been created, what analytics events are tracked,
what UI components have been reused etc. DO NOT ideate on iOS codebase. You do not know how the iOS
app was implemented so please keep just to the description of how the feature was implemented
in Android. IF you want to add code examples, just provide examples directly from Android codebase.
iOS version is in the same place as Android version feature-wise (minus the implementation of this feature) 
so they understand the features we have. I want to create a spec that iOS developers can than
translate into their spec based on Android implementation. Please investigate codebase thoroughly 
as final implementation may differ from the specification a little bit.
