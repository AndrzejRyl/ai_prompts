Please create a CMS API spec based on #$ARGUMENTS. The CMS spec should be technology-agnostic and written for frontend developers who need to understand the API contract. Save it to @ai-specs/cms_specs folder.
Include: endpoints overview, request/response examples, error responses, and usage examples.
NO backend implementation details, no guessing of code on frontend side. Just the API contract.
