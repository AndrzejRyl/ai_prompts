Ok, we can start building a feature from spec #$ARGUMENTS. Please look at CLAUDE.md for any rules you have to abide.
Please remember to track progress inside the spec and mark any of the findings and issues. 
REMEBER - you cannot manually create or move any files because it will mess up iOS file structure and references. You can only read and modify existing files.
Please first ask me to create/move files if you need and than fill them out.
