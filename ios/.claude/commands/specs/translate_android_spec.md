Please look at @CLAUDE.md to understand what type of project we're working on and look on all docs in @ai-specs.
Those are specs for previous features we were working on in this project and guidelines on how to build such specs.
Today we're going to build a new spec. We are ONLY building the spec. NO CODING PLEASE. NO RUNNING COMMANDS. Just simple
spec creation. Below you will find description of the feature we will be building spec for.
Please remember to include sections for progress tracking and learnings.
Today we're building a spec based on android spec from $ARGUMENTS. Please read it carefully and build our next spec based on what was built in Android. 
We will use the same backend, have the same design and we can resuse the same components. Please do not base architecture solutions on Android's codebase.
Please investigate iOS codebase thoroughly to keep patterns and mechanisms from iOS codebase. Android spec is only here to explain what was built on Android side. 
We want to have the same logic but it should be written according to iOS app standards and patterns.
